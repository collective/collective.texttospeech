Life, the Universe, and Everything
==================================

This package enables a Text-to-Speech feature in Plone.

It is currently based on `ResponsiveVoice <http://responsivevoice.org/>`_,
an HTML5-based Text-To-Speech library designed to add voice features to web sites across multiple plataforms.

ResponsiveVoice supports 51 languages through 168 voices and is `free for non-commercial use <http://responsivevoice.org/license/>`_.

Mostly Harmless

Known Issues
------------

- Voice playback rate is slow on Android native browser
- Voice is cut off in shorter text on Android native browser
- Audio doesnâ€™t play on Firefox Android

For more information, see `ResponsiveVoice FAQ <http://responsivevoice.org/faq/>`_.

Some browser add-ons (e.g., `Privacy Badger <https://www.eff.org/privacybadger>`_), could block ResponsiveVoice library disabling the Text-to-Speech feature.
In those cases the 'Listen' button will not be available,
neither the Text-To-Speech control panel configlet will work.

Don't Panic
===========

Installation
------------

To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:

#. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.texttospeech

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to ``collective.texttospeech`` and click the 'Activate' button.

How does it work
----------------

We use JavaScript to extract all text inside an element with ``id="content"`` in the page.
The text extraction will ignore any <iframe> elements present.
Currently, <img> elements are neither processed but that could change in the future.

It is possible to avoid reading some text that,
regardless being present on the text flow,
make little sense on the reading flow.
Examples of this are image captions and side quotes.

We have included a list of CSS classes that can be blacklisted to implement this feature.
The list is configurable via an option in the control panel configlet.
Any text inside an element with one of those CSS classes applied will be ignored.

The blacklist defaults to some CSS classes used in Plone 4:

* ``image-caption``: used for image captions
* ``pullquote``: used for side quotes

Usage
-----

After installing the package, go to the Text-To-Speech configlet on Site Setup.

Select which content types will have the feature enabled and select which voice will be used.
